## Flashcard app

This app can be used by students to generate flashcards that test one's knowledge of course material. As a student
myself, I find flashcards to be an effective tool to have when reviewing course material, especially when preparing
for exams. With this app, I hope to provide other students with a handy tool that saves them time and effort from 
hand-writing their own flashcards.
